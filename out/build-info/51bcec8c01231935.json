constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n ===="},"fullyImplemented":true,"linearizedBaseContracts":[602],"name":"Initializable","nameLocation":"2367:13:4","scope":603,"usedErrors":[351,354],"usedEvents":[359]}],"license":"MIT"}},"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol":{"id":5,"ast":{"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol","id":769,"exportedSymbols":{"ERC1967Utils":[324],"IERC1822Proxiable":[30],"UUPSUpgradeable":[768]},"nodeType":"SourceUnit","src":"115:6208:5","nodes":[{"id":604,"nodeType":"PragmaDirective","src":"115:24:5","nodes":[],"literals":["solidity","^","0.8",".22"]},{"id":606,"nodeType":"ImportDirective","src":"141:70:5","nodes":[],"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC1822.sol","file":"../../interfaces/draft-IERC1822.sol","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","scope":769,"sourceUnit":31,"symbolAliases":[{"foreign":{"id":605,"name":"IERC1822Proxiable","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":30,"src":"149:17:5","typeDescriptions":{}},"nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1"}],"unitAlias":""},{"id":608,"nodeType":"ImportDirective","src":"212:57:5","nodes":[],"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Utils.sol","file":"../ERC1967/ERC1967Utils.sol","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","scope":769,"sourceUnit":325,"symbolAliases":[{"foreign":{"id":607,"name":"ERC1967Utils","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":324,"src":"220:12:5","typeDescriptions":{}},"nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1"}],"unitAlias":""},{"id":768,"nodeType":"ContractDefinition","src":"914:5408:5","nodes":[{"id":618,"nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","src":"1041:48:5","nodes":[],"constant":false,"documentation":{"id":612,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"975:61:5","text":"@custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable"},"mutability":"immutable","name":"__self","nameLocation":"1067:6:5","scope":768,"stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":613,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1041:7:5","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"value":{"arguments":[{"id":616,"name":"this","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":-28,"src":"1084:4:5","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_contract$_UUPSUpgradeable_$768","typeString":"contract UUPSUpgradeable"}}],"expression":{"argumentTypes":[{"typeIdentifier":"t_contract$_UUPSUpgradeable_$768","typeString":"contract UUPSUpgradeable"}],"id":615,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"ElementaryTypeNameExpression","src":"1076:7:5","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_type$_t_address_$","typeString":"type(address)"},"typeName":{"id":614,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1076:7:5","typeDescriptions":{}}},"id":617,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"kind":"typeConversion","lValueRequested":false,"nameLocations":[],"names":[],"nodeType":"FunctionCall","src":"1076:13:5","tryCall":false,"typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"private"},{"id":622,"nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","src":"1732:58:5","nodes":[],"constant":true,"documentation":{"id":619,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1096:631:5","text":" @dev The version of the upgrade interface of the contract.
